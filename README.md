# PhD thesis: Deep neural networks and statistical models for studying DNA methylation in single cells

My PhD thesis on deep neural networks and statistical models for analysing DNA
methylation in single cells. The thesis summarizes the following publications:
* Smallwood et al., [*Single-Cell Genome-Wide Bisulfite Sequencing for Assessing Epigenetic Heterogeneity.*](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n8/full/nmeth.3035.html)
* Angermueller et al., [*Parallel Single-Cell Sequencing Links Transcriptional and Epigenetic Heterogeneity.*](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v13/n3/full/nmeth.3728.html)
* Angermueller et al., [*Deep Learning for Computational Biology.*](http://msb.embopress.org/content/12/7/878)
* Angermueller et al., [*Accurate Prediction of Single-Cell DNA Methylation States Using Deep Learning.*](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/01/055715)
